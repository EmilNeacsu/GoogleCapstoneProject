HR Analytics Capstone Project – Employee Retention Prediction
📌 Project Description

This repository contains the final capstone project for the Google Data Analytics specialization. The project analyzes HR data from WN Electronics to provide data-driven recommendations for improving employee retention.

The main objective is to explore the dataset, identify the key factors influencing attrition, and build predictive models that estimate the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.

📁 Dataset

The dataset is available on Kaggle: HR Analytics and Job Prediction
.

Size: 14,999 rows × 10 columns

Main variables:

satisfaction_level – employee job satisfaction (0–1)

last_evaluation – performance review score (0–1)

number_project – number of projects assigned

average_monthly_hours – monthly working hours

time_spend_company – years at the company

Work_accident – whether an accident occurred at work

promotion_last_5years – promotion history

Department – employee department

salary – salary level

left – whether the employee left the company (target variable)

🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand employee characteristics.

Identify correlations and trends associated with employee turnover.

Build and evaluate classification models to predict attrition.

Provide practical HR insights to support employee retention strategies.

🛠️ Methodology

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Model evaluation and interpretation of feature importance

📊 Key Insights

Satisfaction level and workload (projects, hours) are strong predictors of attrition.

Salary and promotion opportunities significantly influence retention.

Predictive models help HR identify employees at risk of leaving and take preventive action.

💻 Technologies Used

Python: pandas, numpy

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook
