# 📊 HR Analytics Capstone Project – Employee Retention Prediction

This repository contains the final **capstone project** for the *Google Data Analytics Specialization*.  
The project analyzes HR data from **WN Electronics** to provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving employee retention.

The main objective is to **explore the dataset**, identify the **key factors influencing attrition**, and build **predictive models** that estimate the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.
